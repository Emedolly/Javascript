Arrays and loops practise

Using array index can retreive and update an element 

To get the last index item we will use .length-1 which will return the position of the array index but have use the array variable name so that we can get the actual array index item 

.push will overwrite the existing array and the original one is mutated 
and we will use this to add items at the end or to modify something
